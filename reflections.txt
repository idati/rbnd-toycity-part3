How long did you spend working on this project
10 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered
it was definitely the topic Inheritance, can do very complex interleaves -
cannot see the wood for the trees - but on the other hand you its so easy and quick to use - love it :)
...and GIT

What two additional features did you build Why
added "A way for customers to return items" and "Better ways to find transactions" because these are
my experiences in work - that would be very helpful in daily live.

Where do you still have room to grow
good question, i am at the beginning of my "ruby journey" but in the end i would like to say,
"I learned how to write complex software in an efficient way"
